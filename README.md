Studying HTML, CSS and JS 
this repository is made of exercises that i am doing to learn html, css and js, so will have a bunch of documents, nothing important, i guess.
i'm learning git and github too, so don't mind if there are something wrong with my "commits" and those things 'cause i'm new at this.
